## Go Pokedex

Basic REPL pokedex written in Go.

Initially created using the boot.dev course as a guide. Planning to expand some of the functionality to include some more game mechanics.

## Getting the project running

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/)

### Running the project

1. Clone the project

```bash
git clone
```

2. Run the project

```bash
  go build && ./pokedex-cli  
```

## Planned features
- Cycle through previous command by pressing up arrow.
- Simulate battles between pokemon.
- Generate a party of pokemon and allow them to level up and evolve.
- Gamify this a bit and add cash and maybe an interface to the CLI.
